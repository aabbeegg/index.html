        <h3><strong>More about why i chose Moringa school</strong></h3>
        <p>
            Am recently from highschool currently waiting for the KUCCPS enrolment program.
            I chose to study at Moringa so as to get a good background of web development.
            By doing this i was sure I could get a good foothold in terms of studying software development so that i could have a good grasp on the subject by the time i join campus.
            I have also heard from alumni of the school of how patient the technical mentors at Moringa are with their students making sure they give their best while teaching the students which also encouraged me to join the school.
